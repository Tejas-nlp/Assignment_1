1. What is a neural network neuron?
Ans- They are a set of neurons organized in layers, each neurons is a mathematical operation that takes it's input, multiplies it by it's weight and then passes the sum through the activation function to the next layer of neurons.

2. What is the use of the learning rate?
Ans- Learning rate controls how quickly the model is adapted to the problem. It's a turning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving towards a minimum of a loss function.

3.How are weights initialized?
Ans- Zero initialization and Random initialization.

4. What is "loss" in a neural network?
Ans- It's an error of neural net and the method to calculate the loss is called loss function which is used to calculate the gradient a which in return is used to update the weights of the neural netwrok.

5. What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?
Ans- The algorithm is used to effectively train a neural network through a method is called chain rule.
